Internal  1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
A physiologically -based kinetic (PBK) model of cinmethylin in rat species has been developed using 
available physico -chemical (PhysChem) and in vitro data and has been applied to predict the effect 
of human exposure to cinmethylin on thyroid hormone levels in humans.  
The model describes the kinetics of the parent compound cinmethylin, using available PhysChem 
data and cinmethylin degradation kinetics measured in vitro in rat hepatocytes. The model 
adequately describes concentrations of cinmethylin in rat plasma and liv er tissue at doses of 15 
mg/kg bw and 350 mg/kg, with predicted concentrations being within the two -fold deviation from 
measured. No differentiation between male and female rats was modeled, as the available TK data 
does not show a consistent sex differenc e, and the reported in vitro metabolization data was 
obtained for the mix of male and female hepatocytes. A detailed description of the PBK model is 
provided in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 6.2, and 7.1. 
The applicability of the Thyroid Hormones (TH) Quantitative Systems Toxicology (QST) for the 
prediction of the effect of UGT inducers on TH levels in rats and humans is shown in the example 
of phenobarbital. Using in vitro measured induction values (Emax a nd EC50), the model can predict 
decreased T4 and T3 concentrations and increased TSH concentrations in rats, with predicted 
changes being within the reported range. In accordance with the observed data, the model predicts 
no change in T4 and T3 concentrati ons and only a minor increase in TSH concentrations in humans 
after 14 days of administration of 100 mg phenobarbital daily. A detailed description of the 
phenobarbital model is provided in X Appendix F . Therefore, the model was applied to predict the 
effect of exposure to cinmethylin using Emax and EC50 values derived from in vitro induction 
experiments. The same parameter values were applied for rats and humans, as there were no clear 
differences in the observed fold -increases of T4 -GT activity. The model adequately describes in vitro 
and in vivo UGT induction and the effect on TH concentrations in rats at high doses of cinmethylin. 
A detailed description of the prediction of UGT induction by cinmethylin in rats is provided in 
Sections 5.3, 6.3, and 7.2. 
Finally, the model has been applied to predict the effect of exposure to cinmethylin on TH levels in 
humans. As cinmethylin is a pesticide with no intended application in humans, the exposure 
scenarios were designed to represent the worst -case exposure. The following scenarios were 
simulated:  
1. 350 mg/kg bw administered with diet over 28 days : The human exposure to cinmethylin 
was simulated applying the same body -weight normalized dose as in the rat study. The 
dose was administered with the diet over 28 days, simulated as a constant intragastric 
infusion.

Internal  2. 350 mg/kg once daily for 28 days : The same daily exposure as in scenario 1) was simulated 
as acute administration of 350 mg/kg bw cinmethylin once daily for 28 days.  
3. 100 mg once daily for 28 days : The human exposure to cinmethylin was simulated under 
the assumption of a once -daily acute exposure to 100 mg cinmethylin.  
The model predicts no effect  on the T3 and T4 concentrations and only a minor increase of TSH 
levels in the human body for any of the exposure scenarios. The simulated exposure to 350 mg/kg 
predicts liver tissue concentrations of cinmethylin above 100 µM, which is above the highest 
exposure applied in vitro and is unlikely to be achieved in real -life situations. It can be therefore 
concluded that based on simulation results, cinmethylin's potency to induce TH changes in humans 
is comparable or lower than th at of phenobarbital.  Details are described in Section 8. 
2 PROJECT BACKGROUND  
BASF SE (BASF)  is the manufacturer of  the compound Cinmethylin (C -SD95481, BAS 684 H) . 
Cinmethylin is a herbicide developed for the selective pre -emergence control of many annual grass 
weeds in a wide range of temperate and tropical crops ( PubChem, n.d. ).  A physiologically -based 
kinetic  (PBK)  model of cinmethylin has been developed  by ESQlabs  to perform simulation -based 
analys es of exposure in rat and humans and the induction of T4 -UGT activity and its effect on thyroid 
hormone homeostasis . 
3 ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES  
The analysis cover s the following research questions : 
1. Implementation of a PBK model for cinmethylin in rats  and simulation of expo sure 
2. Model -based e xtrapolation of cinmethylin exposure to humans  
3. Integration  of cinmethylin PBK model with the existing thyroid hormones (TH) Quantit ative 
Systems Toxicology (QST)  model  
4. Simulation of T4 -UGT induction by cinmethylin in rats  
5. Prediction of the effect of exposure to cinmethylin  on TH levels in humans

Internal  4 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND  
In in vivo studies, c inmethylin  was shown to reduce T4 and increase TSH concentrations in rats.  
Therefore, cinmethylin  is considered a thyroid disruptor in rats.  In vivo and in vitro data exist to show 
that cinmethylin is a liver enzyme inducer. A model -based integrative analysis was performed to 
investigate the potential of  cinmethylin’s to disrupt TH homeostasis in humans. Physiologically -
based models of both cinmethylin kinetics and thyroid hormone hom eostasis have been developed 
to simulate cinmethylin effects on T3, T4 and TSH concentrations in rats and humans.

6 METHODS  
6.1 SOFTWARE AND GENERAL CONCEPTS  
The PBPK models were implemented using the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite (OSPS or OSP -
Suite) PBPK and QSP software tools PK -Sim and MoBi (version 12). For model applications and 
generations of final figures, esqlabsR (version 5.2), R (distribution 4.1) and RStudio (version 2023.09) 
was used in the analysis for pre - and post -processing of data and model simulation output.  
The general principles of physiologically -based modeling and the applied software are described in 
V Appendix A . 
The TH QST model used for the predictions of TH homeostasis is described in VI Appendix B , VII 
Appendix C , VIII Appendix D , and IX Append ix E. 
The phenobarbital (PB) PB QST model used as the qualification of the applicability of the TH QST 
platform to predict the effects of UGT inducers is described in X Appendix F . 
The list of all species -specific parameter versions is given in XI Appendix G . 
6.2 PBK  MODEL DEVELOPMENT FOR CINMETHYLIN IN RATS AND HUMANS  
Cinmethylin is rapidly metabolized, and most of the performed kinetics  studies report total 
radioactivity data only. Parent concentration data are available for oral single dose administrations 
of 15 mg/kg bw and 350 mg/kg bw as % of administered dose. Separate values are available for 
male and female rats and two different cinmethylin labels (phenyl and cyclohexane).  
This model only considers the parent metabolite and is built using only PK data for the parent.

Internal  6.2.1 Oral absorption  
Cinmethylin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with 78 -99% of administered radioactivity 
being recovered in urine and bile after single and repeated oral dose (rat studies) (BAS 684 H MCA 
Section 5, page 7, also Table 5.1.1 -73). 
The reported systemic bioavailability of 70% is calculated from AUC ratio after iv and po 
administrations for the total radioactivity:  
“Dose corrected ratios of the AUCs after oral (15 mg/kg bw) and i.v. dosing (1 mg/kg bw) are 66% 
and 73% for males and females, respectively. Since the AUC values are based on radioactivity 
equivalents in plasma, and metabolic profiles in plasma are not taken into consideration, these 
numbers do not reflect oral bioavailability, but tentatively, these data demonstrate a high absorption 
of the test item after oral dosing.” - BAS 684 H MCA Section 5, Page 134.  
The parent compound’s bioavailability is not reported. However, it can be assumed that the 
absorption of orally administered cinmethylin is close to 100%, as only a minor fraction (between 2 
and 7%) of the parent compound was recovered in feces.  
Reported Aqueous solubility is 0.063, 0.058, and 0.062 mg/ml at 20C, pH 4.1, 7.0, and 9.0, 
respectively. Solubility in organic solvents is much higher with >500 mg/ml (details can be found on 
p. 28f). In DMSO, the solubility is below 12.2 mg/ml (BAS 684 H MCA Section 5 p1214). For modeling 
purposes, the value of 1 mg/ml has been applied. With this value, oral absorption is not limited up 
to the highest simulated dose of 350 mg/kg bw.  
Specific intestinal permeability is calculated by PK -Sim based on the compound’s molecular weight 
and lipophilicity.  
6.2.2 Tissue distribution  
Distribution into tissues is described by the partitioning coefficient calculation method 
“Berezhkovskiy” and the cellular permeabilities calculation method “PK -Sim standard.” The 
partitioning calculation methods were selected  by comparing the predicted tissue -to-plasma ratio 
with observed plasma and liver tissue concentrations.  
6.2.2.1  Plasma protein binding  
No plasma protein binding is reported for cinmethylin. BAS 684 H MCA Section 5, Table 5.1.1 -14 
reports the fractionation and distribution of cinmethylin equivalent residues in the blood samples, 
including the contribution of the parent compound (6.3% of whole blood radioactivity in the 
unbound plasma fraction). BAS 684 H MCA Section 5, Table 5.1.1 -93 reports th e proportion (% of 
the administered dose) of the parent compound in plasma (0.01% of the total administered dose).  
An attempt was made to calculate fraction unbound using these data. From the data in Table 5.1.1 -
14, it can be calculated that 6.3% / 71.6 % (radioactivity in total plasma of whole blood radioactivity) 
= 8.8% of total plasma radioactivity  was associated with unbound  parent compound. From the data 
in Table 5.1.1 -93, it can be calculated that 0.01% (parent of the total administered dose) / 0.49%

Internal  (total radioactivity of the total administered dose) = 2.04% of total plasma radioactivity  were 
associated with the total (bound and unbound) parent compound. The data appears to be 
inconsistent. However, it indicates that cinmethylin is likely primarily present in the unbound form in 
plasma. We, therefore, assume that cinmethylin is mostly unbound in plasma and apply an arb itrary 
value of 95% unbound. This assumption is supported by the extremely fast metabolization, which 
requires a fast distribution of t he compound from plasma into tissues.  
6.2.3 Metabolization  
Metabolism is similar across all species (human, rat, dog, rabbit). Degradation time profiles 
measured in vitro in human and rat hepatocytes are summarized in BAS 684 H MCA Section 5, 
p183f, Table 5.1.2 -1 and Table 5.1.2 -2. 
Clearance of cinmethylin is implemented as unspecific liver plasma clearance, with the clearance 
rate constant being derived from the in vitro data. Following in vitro -in vivo extrapolation specifics 
(required for the use of in vitro data in PK -Sim) have b een applied:

6.3.1 Reported evidence  
mRNA induction data were not used for modeling, as mRNA expression does not necessarily 
correlate with enzyme activity. Therefore, only T4 -UGT activity data were used.  
“The pattern observed for UGT induction in rat hepatocytes (UGT2B in both genders) differed from 
the one found in human hepatocytes (UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 in both genders). The mRNA pattern 
was confirmed at activity level with CYP3A being the predominantly ind uced Phase I liver enzyme 
in both species, followed by CYP2B, with a more pronounced effect in rat than in human. BAS 684

MCA Section 5, Page 1099.  
6.3.1.1  Study 23T0066/14X720 - in vitro T4 -UGT activity assays  
When compared to the reference UGT inducer phenobarbital (PB), cimethylin had a comparable 
maximal effect on T4 -UGT activity in female rat hepatocytes (1.58 - vs. 1.56-fold), and a slightly lower 
effect in male rat hepatocytes (1.7 - vs. 2.03-fold). The effect in female human hepatocytes was 
comparable to the effect of PB (1.56 - vs. 1.48-fold), while the effect in male human hepatocytes was 
slightly higher than the effect of PB (1.78 - vs. 1.5-fold). Overall, the fold induction of T4 -UGT activity 
by cinmethylin was comparable in rat and human hepatocytes, while the absolute effect was much 
higher in rat hepatocytes (due to the much higher basal T4 -UGT activity). The maximal effect of 
cinmethylin is comparable to the maximal effect of PB in rat and human hepatocytes.  
6.3.1.2  Study 99C0066/14C162 - in vivo effect  
“The most thyroid hormone mean values in males and females receiving BAS 684 H up to 28 days 
were within respective HCD ranges. The only exceptions were the increased T3 values in low and 
mid dose females on day 22 that were considered incidental in nature  due to lack of statistical 
significance and dose -response relationship (a comparison of day 8 and day 15 T3 mean values with 
HCDs is not possible as corresponding T3 HCDs for -4, 8 and 15 days are not available), and 
decreased T4 value in low and mid dose  females on day -4 that was clearly incidental as occurring 
prior treatment start as well as decreased T4 values in all treated females on day 8, that were 
however, lacking statistical significance and a dose -response relationship and thus, considered 
incidental in nature. In males, the T4 value in high dose animals on day 8 was slightly below the 
corresponding HCD for 8 -13 week old males, but again without statistical significance and otherwise 
within the slightly broader HCD of 14 -23 week males.  
However, due to consistent occurrence, significantly decreased T3 (day 8 and day 29) and T4 levels 
(beginning at study day 15) in top dose males of up to 18% and 16%, respectively, were considered 
to be treatment related  although still within the respective HCDs. Additionally, albeit within 
respective HCD ranges, the increased TSH levels in top dose males by more than 20% from study 
day 15 onwards were considered treatment related . 
All other statistically significant T3, T4 and TSH changes occurred only transiently at some study 
days, lacking any consistency and thus, were considered incidental in nature and not treatment 
related ”. 
“Mean T4 -UDP-GT activity was slightly, albeit not clearly dose -dependently induced in males of all 
treatment groups but was not affected in females after a 14 -day exposure. However, following a 
prolonged exposure for 28 days, T4 -UDP-GT activity was statist ically significantly increased in high

Internal  the high dose males after 14 -day treatment and of the high dose females after 28 -day treatment 
was correlated to dose and thus, was assessed as treatment related”.  
BAS 684 H MCA Section 5, Table 5.8.2 -25 (p1147f) reports T4 -UGT activity in rats after 14 and 28 
days of treatment. The activity is expressed in AU/min/mg protein.  
6.3.1.3  Comparison with Phenobarbital (PB)  
The observed effect of PB on T4 -UGT activity in vitro reported in ( Baze et al. 2024 ) was slightly 
higher than the effect reported in 23T0066/14X720 but still comparable. At 1000 µM, PB increased 
T4-UGT activity by 2.2 -fold in rat hepatocytes and by 1.7 -fold in human hepatocytes. Maximal effect 
(3.7-fold) in rat hepatocytes was observed a t 30000 µM, but incubation of human hepatocytes with 
PB concentrations above 1000 µM resulted in cytotoxicity.  
Cinmethylin was tested up to concentrations of 1000 µM and did not show a clear saturation of the 
induction effect. However, at doses above 30 µM, rat female hepatocytes show a drop of UGT 
activity (less than control), and human hepatocytes showed signs of  cytotoxicity. It is therefore safe 
to assume the induction effect of 1.7 measured at concentrations of 30 µM is close to the maximal 
effect of cinmethylin, as higher exposure would result in cytotoxicity rather than TH perturbation.  
6.3.2 Effect modelling  
UGT induction is modeled as an increase of UGT levels due to increased protein synthesis rate. The 
effect is described by the equation  
𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑥×𝐶𝐼𝑛𝑑
𝐶𝐼𝑛𝑑+𝐸𝐶50 
where 𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximal effect, 𝐶𝐼𝑛𝑑 is the intracellular concentration of the inducer (cinmethylin), 
and 𝐸𝐶50 is the concentration of the inducer at which the effect is half -maximal.  
7 RESULTS  
A PBK model for cinmethylin was developed using physico -chemical information and in vitro 
residual data in rats.  The following physico -chemical parameter values are applied in the models:

7.1 CINMETHYLIN EXPOSURE (STUDY CA 5.1.1/16 ) 
Simulated concentrations of cinmethylin are in good agreement with the reported residuals in 
plasma and liver (all within 2 -fold range). For the low dose of 15mg/kg, plasma concentrations are 
reproduced by the model while the liver concentrations are slightly overpredicted. For the high dose 
(350mg/kg), plasma concentrations are overpredicted while liver concentration is slightly 
underpredicted. Since fractions of unch anged parent excreted to urine were very low, renal 
clearance was assumed to be negligible. Fraction of dose excreted to feces is not captured by the 
model.

Capturing of fraction excreted of the 350mg/kg bw dose was possible by reducing the solubility of 
the compound. However, the resulted in a plateau in the plasma concentration and was discar ded

TH concentrations in control group show vary between the study days, with T3 concentrations 
decreasing over time in both sex groups, and a less consistent increase in TSH levels. These changes 
are clearly not treatment -related. As the model cannot capture these fluctuations, simulated 
treatment effect will be compared with the reported % change from the control group ( 𝛥% in Table

Internal  8 PREDICTIONS OF HUMAN EXPOSURE  
For the predictions of cinmethylin exposure in humans, the same assumptions were made as 
for the rat. All compound -related parameters were kept identical except for the clearance 
that was informed by the in vitro experiments (see Table 7). 
8.1 SIMULATED SCENARIOS  
As cinmethylin is a pesticide with no intended application in humans, the exposure 
scenarios were designed to represent the worst -case exposure. The following scenarios 
were simulated:  
1) 350 mg/kg bw administered with diet over 28 days : The human exposure to cinmethylin 
was simulated applying the same body -weight normalized dose as in the rat study. The 
dose was administered with the diet over 28 days, simulated as a constant intragastric 
infusion.  
2) 350 mg/kg once daily for 28 days : The same daily exposure as in scenario 1) was simulated 
as acute administration of 350 mg/kg bw cinmethylin once daily for 28 days.  
3) 100 mg once daily for 28 days : The human exposure to cinmethylin was simulated under 
the assumption of a once -daily acute exposure to 100 mg cinmethylin.  
8.2 PREDICTED EFFECT ON THYROID HORMONE LEVELS  
The following table shows the predicted TH concentrations as % of the untreated scenario 
(reference) and compared with reported TH changes after treatmen t with phenobarbital

levels in the human body for any of the exposure scenarios. The simulated exposure to 350 mg/kg

Internal  exposure applied in vitro and is unlikely to be achieved in real -life situations. It can be therefore 
concluded that based on simulation results, cinmethylin’s potency to induce TH changes in humans 
is comparable or lower than that of phenobarbital.  
 
9 DISCUSSION  
A physiologically -based kinetic (PBK) model of Cinmethylin in rat species has been developed using 
available physico -chemical (PhysChem) and in vitro data and has been applied to predict the effect 
of human exposure to cinmethylin on thyroid hormone levels  in humans.  
The model describes the kinetics of the parent compound cinmethylin, using available PhysChem 
data and cinmethylin degradation kinetics measured in vitro in rat hepatocytes. The model 
adequately describes concentrations of cinmethylin in rat plasma and liv er tissue at doses 15 mg/kg 
bw and 350 mg/kg, with predicted concentrations being within the two -fold deviation from 
measured. No differentiation between male and female rats was modeled, as the available TK data 
does not show a consistent sex difference, and the reported in vitro metabolization data was 
obtained for the mix of male and female hepatocytes.  
The applicability of the Thyroid Hormones (TH) Quantitative Systems Toxicology (QST) platform (VI 
Appendix B , VII Appendix C , VIII Appendix D , and IX Appendix E ) for the prediction of the effect of 
UGT inducers on TH levels in rats and humans is shown in the example of phenobarbital ( X Appendix 
F). Using in vitro measured induction values (Emax and EC50), the model can predict decreased T4 
and T3 concentrations and increased TSH concentrations in rats, with predicted changes being 
within the reported range. In accordance with the observed data, the  model predicts no change in 
T4 and T3 concentrations and only a minor increase in TSH concentrations in humans after 14 days 
of administration of 100 mg phenobarbital daily.  
Therefore, the model was applied to predict the effect of exposure to cinmethylin using Emax and 
EC50 values derived from in vitro induction experiments. The same parameter values were applied 
for rats and humans, as there were no clear differences in the observed fold -increases of T4 -GT 
activity. The model adequately describes in vitro and in vivo UGT induction and the effect on TH 
concentrations in rats at high doses.  
Finally, the model has been applied to predict the effect of exposure to cinmethylin on TH levels in 
humans. The model predicts no effect  on the T3 and T4 concentrations and only a minor increase 
of TSH levels in the human body for any of the exposure scenarios. The simulated exposure of 350 
mg/kg predicts liver tissue concentrations of cinmethylin above 100 µM, which is above the highest 
exposure applied in vitro and is unlikely to be achieved in real -life situations. It can be therefore

Internal  concluded that based on simulation results, cinmethylin's potency to induce TH changes in humans 
is comparable or lower than that of phenobarbital.  
 
The PBK model of cinmethylin assumes linear clearance since not enough information is available 
to inform non -linearity. However, the in vitro experiments showed a plateau for human hepatocytes 
in the beginning of the experiment which could indicate a non -linearity for high concentrations.  
Since the hepatocytes were mixtures of both sexes , no information on sex -related differences in 
metabolism was available and t he model does not consider potential sex differences in the 
metabolism of cinmethylin. It is hy pothesized that the higher accumulation of Cinmethylin in rat 
hepatocytes (probably due to slower metabolization than in males) is the reason for the observed 
differences in UGT induction. The model predicts the effect close to the one observed in males an d 
can be therefore considered as the prediction of the worst -case of the effect.  
The observed data used for PBK model development and validation  was extracted and calculated 
from observed total radioactive residuals in plasma and liver. No information on variability was 
included.  Residuals in kidney were not further taken into consideration since they are lower than 
liver residuals (no toxicity expected) and assumed to not contribute to the inductive effect on T4 -
UGT. 
Fraction of unchanged parent excreted to feces  was not reproduced by the model but  could be 
explained by intestinal deglucuronidation of metabolized parent  (pathway not included in model) . 
This hypothesis is supported by the fact that both doses (15mg/kg and 350mg/kg) show the same 
fractions excreted, it is unlikely to be unabsorbed compound due to solubility limitation.  
The model does not consider histological alterations that could contribute to observed TH 
alterations such as liver or thyroid growth or structur al change . Also, no  further pathophysiological 
alterations, such as albumin increase, observed in vivo , are considered . 
 
10 CONCLUSION  
The simulation results suggest that cinmethylin is not an active TH disruptor in humans. It’s 
potency  potency to induce TH changes in humans is comparable or lower than that of 
phenobarbital.

V.1 METHODS  
V.1.1 Software  
The Open Systems Pharmacology Suite (OSPS ) (PK-Sim and MoBi) provides functionality for the full 
range of PBPK  applications from physicochemistry -based prediction models for all relevant 
preclinical and clinical species to elaborated simulations for drug -drug interactions and special 
populations. The suite comprises functionalities for parameter identification, mo del qualification, 
and automated reporting as well as interfaces to R (The R Project for Statistical Computing, www.R -
project.org) and MATLAB ( The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA ; Note: The MATLAB Toolbox is 
deprecated ) as depicted in Figure 8. 
 
Figure 8: Architecture of the OSP suite : The OSP suite consists of the graphical user interfaces PK -Sim and MoBi, toolboxes 
for MATLAB and R, and builds on a single computational simulation kernel. Import/export functionality for different data 
formats and model languages are built -in. 
V.1.2 PBPK Modeling  
The PBPK analyses will be performed using qualified installations of the PBPK software PK -Sim 
(version 9.1). If applicable, R (distribution 4.0) and RStudio (Version 1.2.5) will be used in the analysis 
for pre - and post -processing of data and model output (Kuepfer et al. 2016) . The analytical approach 
is based on principles established in the EMA , FDA, and/or OECD  guidelines on the reporting of 
PBPK M&S  (EMA 2019; FDA 2019; OECD 2021) .  
A whole -body PBPK model ( Figure 9) contains an explicit representation of the organs that are most 
relevant to the absorption, distribution, excretion, and metabolization of the drug. These are 
typically heart, lung, brain, stomach, spleen, pancreas, gut, liver, kidney, gonads, thymus, ad ipose 
tissue, muscle, bone, and skin. Relevant is the physiological/pharmacological function, the volume 
of each organ (Peters 2012) , organ composition, surface areas, and expression levels of proteins. 
The tissues are linked by the arterial and venous blood compartments, and each one of them is

Figure 9: Representation of the generic structure of a whole -body PBPK model.  
Consequently, PBPK models are a comprehensive structural representation of the physiology, while 
most parameters are either obtained from compilations of prior knowledge or are based on carefully 
validated formulas. As a result, it is possible to distinguish between pre -informed organ ism 
parameters on the one hand and drug parameters on the other ( Figure 10). Even though a PBPK 
model may comprise several hundreds of ordinary differential equations, the number of 
independent model parameters for a new compound is usually small (in most cases, fewer than five 
per compound), due to the large amount of prior, in dependent physiological information that is 
incorporated. As in the case of the distribution models, also these compound -specific parameters 
are usually kept unchanged across different species or administration protocols.

Figure 10: Representation of the general building blocks that can be part of a PBPK model . Some components may be 
optional, depending on the model considered.  
Drug properties, such as compound lipophilicity, solubility, and molecular weight (MW ) of a drug, 
are fully independent of organism physiology. In comparison, drug -biological properties, such as 
the fraction of drug unbound in plasma or tissue -plasma partition coefficient, are drug -specific but 
also defined by the interaction between the d rug and the biological system itself. By combining the 
drug properties with the anatomical and physiological features of the organism, it is possible to 
estimate the parameters for passive processes involved in distributing the drug in the body, such as 
permeation across membranes.  
Finally, information on the administration protocol and formulation properties is needed to define 
a PBPK simulation. Time -related special events such as gallbladder emptying or meal intake can also 
be included in the model, and their impact on drug PK  can be evaluated.  
V.1.3 PBPK Best Practices  
The increasing number of PBPK use cases and submissions motivated regulatory agencies to 
develop guidelines for best practices in PBPK modeling, model qualification and reporting of 
modeling studies (EMA, n.d.; FDA 2019) . Schemes of the PBPK model -building workflow for small 
(also to some extent applicable to large) molecule drugs are provided in Figure 11 and Figure 12. 
As the first step in model development, available drug -specific ADME  information is gathered. For 
instance, clearance processes, transporters, or specific binding partners are relevant to build 
physiologically plausible models. The appropriate level of detail in representing the relevant 
processes and the criteria for mode l evaluation depends on the particular aims, objectives, and 
applications of the model as well as on the availability of data and information. Depending on their 
availability, data commonly used in PBPK model building includes time –concentration profiles o f the 
drug and its metabolites in either plasma or tissues, the percentages of drug excreted via the urine

Internal  and feces, but also mass balance data for different preclinical species or humans. Moreover, different 
application routes, different dosages, or application schemes are developed.  
 
Figure 11: Predict, Learn, and Confirm cycle in PBPK model development . Based on a priori data contained in the PBPK 
database and collected as drug -specific properties, the initial model is iteratively refined as new experimental data becomes 
available. Once established for healthy volunteers, the PBPK model can be used to extrapolate to specific use -scenarios.  
In the second step, a method for calculation of organ/plasma partition coefficients, frequently 
referred to as the distribution model, is chosen to describe the drug distribution behavio ur. The 
distribution model is compound -specific and should consistently describe the compound 
distribution independent of the considered species or administration protocol.  
Within a model development and qualification process (process depicted in  Figure 13), a subset  of 
available experimental PK data are used during model development to identify unknown or 
uncertain parameters, and another subset may be used for validation of the model in a specific use -
scenario. In vivo concentration -time profiles after IV administration can be used to re -assess the 
choice of the distribution model and to adapt clearance parameters. Surrogate compound 
parameters, like lipophilicity, are usually corrected at this stage to obtain a good agreement with 
experimental IV data.  
Mass balance data can be used to inform different elimination pathways, and associated metabolic 
rates can be obtained using In Vitro – In Vivo Extrapolation (IVIVE ) approaches. For liver clearance, 
numerous in vitro assays are available to estimate the enzymatic activity. Liver clearance needs to 
be rescaled to the whole -organ in vivo  situation. For example, activity can be derived from 
recombinant cytochromes, human hepatocytes, or human liver microsomes. For an IVIVE, the 
experimentally measured specific activity needs to be multiplied by the amount of the catalyzing 
agent (amount of  cytochrome, number of hepatocytes, or amount of microsomal protein) per gram 
of liver tissue to obtain the specific intrinsic clearance  per gram of liver. The ratio of Vmax/Km

Internal  describes the intrinsic metabolic clearance for unsaturated conditions, which can be derived from 
in vitro studies in human liver microsomes.  
If the selection of distribution models and adjustment of parameters are not sufficient to describe 
the IV data, relevant processes may have not yet been taken into account in the model. In such 
cases, active transport or binding partners can be incorporated based on current knowledge or as 
testable hypothesis. Such additional processes might also be needed to  explain features such as 
dose nonlinearity, the observed extent of clearance, or the drug distribution. When introducing 
additional processes, it is best to include as much experimental data as possible (e.g., Km  and Kd  
values, the abundance of the enzyme, binding partner). It should be noted that data for different 
doses have to be available (showing dose -nonlinearity) to be able to identify Michaelis -Menten 
parameters, e.g., for transporters or clearances.

V.1.4 PBPK/PD Modeling  
Pharmacodynamic modeling within PBPK models (PBPK/PD) offers a mechanistic framework to 
quantify the pharmacodynamic s (PD) effect on targeted molecule concentration levels. Thereby, the 
final model couples the simulation of drug levels on the one hand with the simulation of the on - 
and off -target tissue concentrations and effect relations.  
Since different organs are explicitly represented in PBPK models, on - and off -target tissue exposure 
can be directly quantified. This enables consideration of therapeutic or toxic effects by the coupling

Internal  of PD to the corresponding PBPK models. To this end, tissue concentration profiles simulated with 
PBPK models may be used as input for downstream PD models. Notably, this coupling of PK and 
PD results in a multiscale PBPK/PD model that simultaneously descr ibes drug ADME at the whole -
body level and the resulting drug effect at the cellular or tissue scale. In the simplest case, PD models 
may represent simple proliferation models quantifying, for example, bacterial growth in infection 
biology (Schuck et al. 2005)  or tumor growth in oncology (Simeoni et al. 2004) . Given the ever -
growing number of systems biology models at different scales of biological organization, the PD 
disease or toxicity models may be widely expanded. These more detailed, mechanism -based, PD 
models are often related to as Quantitative Systems  Pharmacology (QSP ) models. When based 
upon a PBPK backbone, we refer to these models as PB -QSP models.  
V.1.5 PB-QSP Modeling  
Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) provides more biological and mechanistic detail than 
PK/pharmacodynamic models, and, in rare cases, may even reach the level of pathway information 
provided by systems biology models. I n most cases, however, QSP is tailored to the needs of 
pharmacologists and only considers biological mechanisms when necessary to answer advanced 
questions of coupled information in drug development:  
▪ How does a drug influence biological components and their interaction?  
▪ How does biology influence or compensate drug efficacy via feedbacks?  
▪ How much does the biological uncertainty influence the uncertainty of the drug effect?  
▪ How much does the biological uncertainty contribute to the risks?  
▪ Which properties of the compound have to be changed, and which experiments are the 
most useful to be performed?  
▪ Is monotherapy sufficient, or is a combination therapy necessary?  
▪ Which degree of disease severity can be treated by the compound?  
▪ Which responsive patient subsets can be identified?  
Mechanism - and physiologically -based modeling integrates (most of) the current understanding 
and available information on biological processes by transforming them into an explicit, consistent, 
and testable (model) format.  
Examples of detailed PBPK -based QSP models include glucose -insulin regulation in diabetes 
(Schaller et al. 2013) , management of endometriosis (Riggs et al. 2012) , acetaminophen intoxication 
(Krauss et al. 2012) , drug -induced liver injury (Thiel et al. 2017)  or model -based design and analysis 
of antithrombotic therapies (Burghaus et al. 2014) . Ultimately, such PB -QSP models aim for a 
mechanistic and physiological representation of systems interactions within the body (Danhof 2016) , 
thereby providing an important toolbox for disease or toxicity modeling in quantitative systems 
pharmacology.  
An established PB -QSP model can be used to optimize decisions throughout the drug development 
process, empower scientific communication, can easily be adapted when new data challenge the

Internal  current comprehension, and always represents the most complete and evidence -based 
understanding of therapy and disease. The usual workflow to generate a PB -QSP model is visualized 
in Figure 13. 
V.1.6 PB-QSP Best Practices  
ESQlabs  best practices follow recommendations of the scientific community for a proper Model 
Qualification Method (Friedrich 2016) , as shown in Figure 13. A model without an adequate 
qualification will not be useful for decision -making. Thus, model qualification serves to ensure that 
the model can be trusted, i.e., is appropriate and robust enough for the intended use.   
Relevance  
The model is checked for its alignment with the research context and scope of the study. The aim 
is to set up the model in a way that serves the sponsor´s requirements, such as de -risk next steps, 
to design follow -up experiments, or to adjust the drugs to the biological mechanisms and relevant 
patient groups. Therefore, the work has to be completed in a timely fashion to serve the decision 
process. The whole modeling process needs to be subdivided into different stages, with specific 
milestones defining the  questions which have to be answered. Any developments that obscure and 
delay results or impair later model extension and applications should be avoided.  
Moreover, it has to be ensured that the underlying assumptions confirm the current state of the art 
in biology and pharmacology. Therefore, all implemented actions have to be well described and 
graphically represented to enable assessment by experts. All p arameters must have biologically 
reasonable values. A model can only be useful if it is up to date, is fit for its purpose, and is ready 
to answer questions early enough.

model development, ESQlabs  considers all of these stages, where applicable. As in PBPK, PB -QSP model development may 
require a number of iterations until an appropriate model structure is defined. Moreover, several characteristics of the mode l 
can be assessed and checked to gain co nfidence in model reliability.

Internal  Uncertainty  
For the model to provide valid results and enable reliable conclusions, it must be robust against 
biological uncertainty. The (inferred) results can differ based on the assumptions taken, and it has 
to be clear on which assumptions the corresponding conclu sions are based upon. Furthermore, 
critical uncertainties which increase the risk of project failure have to be identified early and the 
necessary steps have to be taken, e.g. by recommendations for design -of-experiments, to reduce 
uncertainty and the asso ciated risk sufficiently.  
Variability  
Inter- and intra -patient variability have to be considered and both, used to judge the observations 
/ provided data, and the impact on the model development. Biological mechanisms have to be 
investigated for their explanatory value for inter - and intra -patient variability. Especially the range 
of endpoints should be explained on the base of modelled mechanisms.  
Data  
Model structure, parameters, and simulation result must match available data and must be 
consistent with current knowledge and expectations.   
Data Analysis  
The visual comparison of simulated vs. experimental concentration -time profiles (plasma or tissue) 
focuses on the absolute concentrations and the dynamic shape of the PK profile. Typical PK 
parameters like C max, Tmax, AUC , and T 1/2 are provided as well as errors such as root -mean -square 
error (RMSE ). The latter reflects the uncertainty of both experiment and simulation.  Thus, modeling 
allows the critical re-evaluation  of the model (simulation) in the context of the experimental data 
source. Predictivity of the model can be assessed through model qualification by comparison to 
data not used for model development.  
ESQlabs  will create several analysis outputs for the assessment of the results from model building, 
qualification, and simulation. The respective endpoint of interest  will be presented in the form of 
metrics and several types of plots.  
Metrics used for results assessment are:  
- AUC ratios predicted/observed  
- Cmax ratios predicted/observed  
- Tmax ratios predicted/observed (if applicable, e.g. not for IV)  
- T1/2 (half-life / clearance) ratios predicted/observed  
Plot types used for results assessment are:  
- Goodness -of-Fit Plots  
o Predicted or simulated vs. observed plasma concentration  
o Weighted residuals over time

VI.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Modeling thyroid pathophysiology and studying interspecies differences require accounting for 
important plasma binding proteins. This report summarizes the modeling steps, assumptions, 
and possible limitations for implementing plasma binding proteins in th e Thyroid PB -QST 
Platform.  
The thyroid hormones (TH) T3 and T4 bind to the plasma proteins albumin, thyroxine -binding 
globulin (TBG), and transthyretin (TTR), as well as to lipoproteins. In humans, approximately 0.3% 
and 0.03% of serum T3 and T4 are present in the free form, respect ively (Refetoff ( 2000 )). In rats, 
between 0.5% and 0.67% of serum T3 (Yang et al. ( 2018 ), Smallridge et al. ( 1982 )) and between 
0.03% and 0.05% of serum T4 (C M Mendel ( 1992 ), Smallridge et al. ( 1982 )) are present in the 
free form.  
VI.2 MODELING OF PLASMA PROTEINS  
The three plasma binding proteins albumin, TBG, and TTR are modeled in plasma and interstitial 
space. The distribution between plasma and interstitial is described by the two -pores model for 
large proteins implemented in PK -Sim (Niederalt et al. ( 2018 )). 
Human serum albumin concentration in plasma is in the range between 3.5 and 5 g/dl, 4.25 g/dl 
assumed in the mean model (= 4.25×10𝑔/𝑙
66470𝑔/𝑚𝑜𝑙=636𝜇𝑚𝑜𝑙/𝑙) (Moman, Gupta, and Varacallo 
(2023 )). Normal TBG concentration in human plasma is 16 mg/l = 16𝑒−3𝑔/𝑙
54000𝑔/𝑚𝑜𝑙=0.35𝜇𝑚𝑜𝑙/𝑙 
(Refetoff ( 2000 )). The concentration of TTR in human plasma is 250 mg/l = 250𝑒−3𝑔/𝑙
55000𝑔/𝑚𝑜𝑙=
4.54𝜇𝑚𝑜𝑙/𝑙(Refetoff ( 2000 )). 
In rats, albumin concentrations are slightly lower, ranging between 509 and 593 µmol/l (Rose 
and Klemcke ( 2015 )). The value of 593 µmol/l is applied in the model. The same molecular 
weight is assumed in rats and humans. TBG is expressed in pups and old rats, but not in adult 
rats (Savu et al. ( 1991 )). Currently, TBG is not modeled in rats. The concentration of TTR in rat 
plasma is 50 mg/100 ml = 500𝑚𝑔/𝑙
55000𝑔/𝑚𝑜𝑙=9.1𝜇𝑚𝑜𝑙/𝑙 (Wade et al. ( 1988 )). The molecular weight 
of TTR is assumed to be equal in rats and humans.  
The proteins are synthesized in liver plasma with synthesis rates being extracted from literature 
or calculated from reported values (Levitt and Levitt ( 2016 ), Makover et al. ( 1988 ), Gordon and

where 𝑛𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛  is the amount of binding protein, 𝐶𝑇𝐻 is the concentration of (free) T3 or T4, and 
𝑛𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛 _𝑇𝐻 is the amount of protein -TH complex.  
𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓 values have been extracted from Bagga, Johnson, and Zhang ( 2023 ). Dissociation

Reported percentages of T4 bound to TBG, TTR, and albumin in humans are 75, 20, and 5% 
(Refetoff ( 2000 )), respectively. Another source reports 68, 11, and 20%, respectively (Schweizer 
et al. ( 2017 )). Approximately 0.03% are present in unbound form (Refetoff ( 2000 )). 
Reported percentages of T3 bound to TBG, TTR, and albumin in humans are 75, <5, and 20% 
(Refetoff ( 2000 )), respectively. Approximately 0.3% are present in unbound form (Refetoff 
(2000 )). 
Reported percentages of T4 bound to TTR and albumin in adult rat are between between 75% 
and 95% for TTR and about 16% for albumin (C M Mendel ( 1992 ), Davis, Spaulding, and 
Gregerman ( 1970 )). For the recall, literature reports 0.03% - 0.05% of serum T4 in free form (C 
M Mendel ( 1992 ), Smallridge et al. ( 1982 )). TBG is assumed to be absent in adult rat.  
The reported percentage of T3 bound to albumin in the adult rats is nearly 99% (Pardridge 
(1979 )). No information about T3 fraction bound to TTR in rat was found. TBG is assumed to be 
absent in adult rat. Between 0.5% and 0.67% of serum T3 are present in free form (Yang et al. 
(2018 ), Smallridge et al. ( 1982 )) and  
The values predicted by the human and rat models for the distribution of TH in plasma during 
homeostasis are reported in Table 3 .

VI.4 ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS  
• For modeling purposes, no distinction between plasma and serum has been made. The 
majority of available data report values for blood serum. The values in plasma have been 
assumed to be equal.  
• Only one molecule, T3 or T4, binds to the binding proteins. Though TTR has two binding sites 
and albumin has 4 binding sites, only one site is assumed to have high affinity (Refetoff 
(2000)). 
• The model does not consider the binding of T3 and T4 to lipoproteins.  
• T3 and T4 compete for the binding to the proteins - e.g., an Albumin -T4 complex cannot 
bind T3. This would unlikely have any significant effect on the simulations as the plasma 
proteins are not saturated in physiological conditions.  
• Protein -TH complexes are degraded with the same rate constant as the free plasma proteins. 
It is assumed that bound T3 and T4 are released into plasma upon degradation of the 
complex.  
• In humans, using the applied binding constants, the contribution of albumin to both T3 and 
T4, is slightly over -predicted, while the contribution of TBG is slightly under -predicted. The 
free fractions of the hormones are perfectly described.  
• In rats, the contribution of albumin to T3 binding is over -predicted, while the contribution of 
TTR is under -predicted. The free fractions of the hormones are perfectly described.

VII.1 DISTRIBUTION  
For the estimation of distribution kinetics of T3 in rats and humans, T3 concentrations in plasma after iv 
bolus administration were used. The following data sets are available:  
1. iv administration of 8.6e -5 mg T3 in humans (Pilo et al. ( 1990)). Used  for estimation of species -
independent distribution and human -specific clearance parameters.  
2. DiStefano 1982 (J. J. DiStefano et al. (1982)). iv administration of T3 in rats. Administered were 1.5 -2 
µCi T3 (3300 µCi/µg) in 300 -400 g rats. The administered dose was calculated as 1.5 µCi / 3300 µCi/µg 
/ 300 g = 1.51 ng/kg body weight. Reported are T3 concentrations as % dose per ml plasma. The  data 
set has not  been used for fitting.

DiStefano, Malone, and Jang ( 1982)), reported as best -fit curve (no individual data points) of % dose 
per ml plasma. The curve shows data only for the first two hours after administration, whereas 2. reports 
data up to 10 hours. The values are higher that in 2. and are more consistent wit h the model. Not used 
for estimation of species -independent distribution parameters. Simulated with the same dose an in 2.  
4. DiStefano 1993 (J. J. DiStefano, Nguyen, and Yen ( 1993)). iv administration of 0.5 -1 µCi of 1200 µCi/µg 
in 300 -375 g rats, amounting to approximately 1.38 ng/kg body weight. Data are reported as % dose 
in total plasma and have been converted to % dose /ml plasma by dividing the values by plasma volume 
of 15 m l (Table 3 of the publication). Not used for estimation of species -independent distribution 
parameters. Simulated with the same dose as in 2 for convenience reasons since data are reported as 
% of the dose.  
5. Silva 1977 (Silva and Larsen ( 1977)), group E. iv administration of 26 ng / 100 g bw radiolabeled T3. 
Plasma and pituitary gland concentrations after 1 and 2 hours. Concentrations of T3 in pituitary gland 
are reported in ng/mg nuclear DNA and converted to tissue concentration by multiplyin g by 7 mg 
pituitary DNA/g tissue (reported in Silva and Larsen ( 1977) 6.5-7.5 mg/g). Used  for estimation of species -
independent distribution parameters.  
6. Silva 1977 (Silva and Larsen ( 1977)), group A. iv administration of 70 ng / 100 g bw radiolabeled T3. 
Plasma and pituitary gland concentrations up to 7 hours. Concentrations of T3 in pituitary gland are 
reported in ng/mg nuclear DNA. Pituitary tissue DNA content is 7 mg pituitary DNA/g wet  tissue 
(reported in Silva and Larsen ( 1977) 6.5 -7.5 mg/g wet tissue), converted to intracellular DNA 
concentration 7𝑚𝑔/𝑔
0.957 (fraction intracellular of 95.7%). Intracellular T3 concentration is therefore 
calculated by multiplying the reported values in ng/mg DNA by 7𝑚𝑔/𝑔
0.957. Used  for estimation of species -
independent distribution parameters.  
7. Higueret 1982 (Higueret and Garcin ( 1982)). subcutaneous (sc) injection of 5 µCi of 50 µCi/µg in rats 
weighing 245 g, amounting to approximately 408 ng/kg body weight. Reported % of dose per ml 
plasma. The data set was used to parametrize T3 clearance rate in rats. Concentrations of tracer T3 
halved between 10 and 21 hours (half -life of 11 hours).  
Distribution into tissues is described by the partitioning coefficient calculation method “PK -Sim” with the 
cellular permeabilities calculation method “PK -Sim standard”. Binding to plasma proteins is 
implemented as reversible binding to albumin, TBG, and T TR. Details are described in a separate report 
(Thyroid PB -QST Platform - plasma protein binding.pdf).

Internal  The reported lipophilicity of T3 ranges between -2.7 and 2.5 (non -charged form) logP units depending 
on the microspecies of the molecule (Tóth et al. ( 2013)), the value in the model has been set to 2.5 log

Permeability of T3 across endothelial barrier is calculated by PK -Sim from molecular weight and 
lipophilicity. For the liver and pituitary gland, the permeability has been manually set to an arbitrary 
value of 100 cm/min. This value is, by default, applied in a small molecules model of PK -Sim, assuming 
rapid extravasation of small molecules.  
While the observed plasma concentration profile in humans can be well -described with the assumption 
of passive diffusion of T3 across the endothelial barrier, the predicted extravasation of the hormone in 
rats is too slow. An active transport from blood pl asma to interstitial space has been implemented. It is 
assumed that free T3 binds to an unknown transporter protein located at the plasma side of the 
endothelial membrane. The binding is a reversible process, with the rate of T3 association is given by 
the equation  
𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑇3
𝐾𝑑𝑇3×𝐶𝑝𝑙𝑠𝑇3×𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟  
where 𝐶𝑝𝑙𝑠𝑇3 is the concentration of free T3 in plasma, and 𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟  is the amount of free transporter 
on the plasma -side of the endothelial membrane. The T3 -transporter complex can either dissociate to 
free T3 and free transporter in plasma with the rate  
𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑇3×𝑛𝑇3−𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟

Internal  where 𝑛𝑇3−𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟  is the amount of T3 -transporter protein complex, or the complex is transported 
across the endothelial barrier, T3 is released into interstitial space, and the free transporter is 
translocated back to the plasma -side of the endothelial barrier. The rate of  this process (which competes 
with T3 -transporter complex dissociation in plasma) is given by the equation  
𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑇3×𝑛𝑇3−𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟 . 
The expression of the transporter is assumed to be equal in all tissues. No species -specific differences 
in binding kinetics or the expression of the transporter were assumed. Reference concentration (i.e., the 
expression) of the transporter, the binding k inetic parameters 𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑇3 and 𝐾𝑑𝑇3, and the rate constant of 
T3 dissociation in interstitial space 𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑇3 have been estimated by fitting the model to time -concentration 
profiles of T3 described above. The thyroid organ has been excluded from the endothelial transport 
process as it is assumed that the main function of the thyroid is to release T3 and T4 into i nterstitial 
space.  
Of important note is that the parameters cannot be reliably identified with the available data and should 
be considered as hypotheses to describe the observed data. Additional data that could help to identify 
the parameters are T3 concentrations in the int erstitial space of the tissues.  
The parameter values describing active transport of T3 across the endothelial barrier are listed in  Table

VII.2 CLEARANCE  
Routes of T3 elimination include deiodination in all tissues, sulfation, and glucuronidation. 
Glucuronidation metabolites are excreted via bile. In the small intestinal lumen, glucuronidation 
metabolites can be converted back to active T3 and re -absorbed.  
Following clearance processes are implemented:  
• Glomerular filtration is turned off, as no T3 is detected in urine unchanged (JOSEPH J. 
DiSTEFANO and SAPIN ( 1987)), 
• UGT metabolized elimination,  
• DIO1 metabolized elimination,  
• Unspecific liver clearance in intracellular space.  
UGT2B4 has been selected as the representative for T3 glucuronidation. Expression of UGT2B4 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7363) has been selected from the PK -Sim database using the “EST” 
database.

Clearance     Last saved by: Pavel Balazki  
 
Internal  For model simplicity, de -iodination of T4 to T3 and reverse T3 (rT3), and de -iodination of T3 to T2 is 
assumed to be catalyzed by the same enzyme (DIO1).  
VII.2.1  Rats  
Total hepatic clearance of T3 has been fitted to data sets 5 and 6 (Silva and Larsen ( 1977), Groups A 
and E). The total clearance has then been distributed between the different clearance processes to 
reproduce metabolization fractions reported in ( Boonnamsiri, Kermode, and Thompson 1979 ) observed 
at steady -state during prolonged iv T3 infusion. 25.2% of infused T3 was excreted unchanged in feces. 
Specific clearance of UGT -mediated metabolization has been set to reproduce this value under the 
assumption that UGT -metabolized T3 is excreted  in feces and converted back to T3.  
The de -iodination (57.7% of infused dose ( Boonnamsiri, Kermode, and Thompson 1979 )) is modeled as 
mediated by the DIO enzyme. Specific clearance of DIO mediated clearance of T3 has been set to 
reproduce 57.7% of infused dose being cleared by this process.  
The remaining clearance has been assigned to the unspecific liver plasma cleara nce. 
VII.2.2  Humans  
According to Foster, Tinwell, and Melching -Kollmuss ( 2021), T3 glucuronidation is absent in humans. 
However, incubation of human liver hepatocytes in vitro suggests that T3 glucuronidation is possible in 
humans (Tong et al. ( 2007)), but to a much slower extent that in rats. Given the overall accepted 
assumption that glucuronidation of T3 in humans is not significant and in sight of lack of data that 
would allow a quantitative description of the process, only unspecific liver (intr acellular) clearance is 
implemented for humans. The clearance rate constant has been estimated by fitting the model to 
plasma T3 concentrations after administration of 8.6e -5 mg T3 in humans (Pilo et al. ( 1990)) (Figure 14). 
Parameter values describing the clearance of T3 are listed in Table 13 (see Section below  for explanation 
of the DIO3 mediated clearance):

VII.3 PITUITARY GLAND CONCENTRATIONS  
Silva and Larsen ( 1977) measured concentrations of T3 bound to nuclear T3 receptor in the pituitary 
gland after IV administration of T3 or T4. Maximal T3 binding capacity was estimated to be 0.79 ng T3 
per 1 mg nuclear DNA, or 6.58 ng (0.01 µmol) per g tissue. Nuclear DNA conte nt was measured to be 
7 mg/g tissue ( Oppenheimer, Schwartz, and Surks 1974 ). A T3 receptor (T3R) has been implemented in

Internal  pituitary glad with the concentration of 0.01 µmol/l. The same value is applied for humans in sight of 
absense of experimental data. Free intracellular T3 binds to the T3R to T3R -T3 complex with the rate  
𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑇3−𝑇3𝑅
𝐾𝑑𝑇3−𝑇3𝑅×𝐶𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑇3×𝑛𝑇3𝑅−𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑇3−𝑇3𝑅×𝑛𝑇3𝑅−𝑇3 
From the interstitial space, free T3 enters the cells via passive concentration -gradient -driven diffusion. 
Additionally, T3 can be actively taken up by transporter proteins located at the cell membranes. Without 
having any in vitro data on the capacity of the different tissues for active T3 uptake or tissue 
concentrations of T3, it has been decided to only include the uptake in the pituitary gland, where the 
time concentrations profile of T3 after IV administration in rats are available (Silva and Larsen ( 1977)). 
The transport is implemented in the same way as the transport across the endothelial barrier (see 
Section VII.1). 
Though the active transport process is required to achieve the tissue concentrations in the pituitary 
gland, it leads to a long -term accumulation of T3 in the tissue, which is not supported by data. It is 
known that T3 is metabolized by various DIO enzymes , among which is DIO3, located in the pituitary 
gland. A metabolization process with a linear reaction rate in the pituitary gland was implemented.  
Expression of the cellular T3 transporter in pituitary gland, the kinetic parameters of T3 binding to the 
transporter 𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑇3 and 𝐾𝑑𝑇3, the rate constant of T3 dissociation in intracellular space 𝑘𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑇3, the rate 
constants of T3 binding to the T3 receptor, and the rate constant of T3 metabolization by DIO3 in the 
pituitary cells, have been estimated by fitting the model to time -concentration profiles of T3 bound to 
T3R in pituitary described in (Silva an d Larsen ( 1977), Groups A and E).  
As no data for T3 concentrations in human pituitary tissue is available, the same parametrization 
(including the expression of the transporter and receptor) as in rats is assumed. Incusion of the transport 
process in other tissues is not considered due to lacking data, and adding an active transport leads to 
the accumulation of the compound in tissues. Considering the transport process in the liver only slightly 
improves model fits and has been excluded due to non -identifiability.  
The following parameter values describing active transport of T3 from the interstitial into the intracellular 
space are applied:

Internal  VII.5 SYNTHESIS  
T3 is synthesized in thyroid cells and released into plasma. A two -compartmental model of hormone 
synthesis and secretion has been applied, implemented as two pools of T3 molecules – a slow and a 
ready -to-release pool (RRP), representing vesicles ready to be released into plasma  (Figure 18). 
 
 
Figure 18 Schematic representation of the two -compartmental hormone secretion model  
 
T3 is synthesized and added to the slow pool with the rate 𝑟𝑇3𝑠𝑦𝑛 
𝑟𝑇3𝑠𝑦𝑛=𝑘𝑇3𝑠𝑦𝑛×𝑉𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑡ℎ𝑦𝑟×𝑀𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑇3 
with 𝑘𝑇3𝑠𝑦𝑛 a constant synthesis rate constant, 𝑉𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑡ℎ𝑦𝑟 the volume of thyroid intracellular space, and 𝑀𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑇3 
the effect of TSH:  
𝑀𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑇3=𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇3∗𝐶𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇3
𝐶𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇3+𝐾𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇3 
The transfer from the slow pool to the RRP is given by the rate 𝑟𝑇3𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 
𝑟𝑇3𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠=𝑛𝑇3𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑤×𝑘𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑒𝑟  
with 𝑛𝑇3𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑤 being the amount of T3 in the slow pool and 𝑘𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑒𝑟  the rate constant.  
T3 is released into the thyroid plasma with the rate 𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑇3 
𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑇3=𝑛𝑇3𝑅𝑅𝑃×𝑘𝑠𝑒𝑐 
The second source of T3 is the conversion of T4 to T3 in the tissues by the enzyme deiodinase (DIO). 
The expression of DIO in thyroid has been selected to reproduce the observed fraction of T3 derived 
from thyroid.  
No data could not be identified that would allow to directly parametrize the effect of TSH on T3 
secretion. It has been assumed that TSH stimulates secretion of T3 with same potency as T4, therefore, 
the same parameter values as for T4 secretion are applie d.

Internal  VII.5.1  Rats  
The reported contribution of T3 synthesis to the total appearance of T3 in rats is controversial. Chanoine 
et al. ( 1993) conducted a set of experiments with thyroidectomized rats with T4 supplementation and a 
selenium -deficient diet. They concluded that 55% of T3 is synthesized in the thyroid, while ( Kinlaw, 
Schwartz, and Oppenheimer 1985 ) concludes that virtually all T3 is produced from T4 in extrathyroidal 
tissues.  
When applying T4 metabolization pathway contributions as described in Boonnamsiri, Kermode, and 
Thompson ( 1979) (33% of iv -infused T4 being converted to T3) and setting the T4 secretion rate to 
reproduce basal plasma T4 levels reported in Chanoine et al. ( 1993) (46 nmol/l), the model predicts 
exactly the measured basal T3 levels (1.6 nmol/l) without any thyroidal T3 production. Therefore, the 
model supports the theory that thyroidal T3 production is negligible in rats, and the rate constant of T3 
𝑘𝑇3𝑠𝑦𝑛 has been set to 0.  
The model predicts that 0 % of total T3 is synthesized in thyroid.  
Reported basal T3 concentrations are 0.4±0.2 (SEM) ng/ml (0.61 nmol/l) (Heide and Ende -Visser 
(1980)), and 0.73 ± 0.09 and 0.54 ± 0.05 ng/ml (1.12 and 0.82 nmol/l, respectively) ( Kinlaw, Schwartz, 
and Oppenheimer 1985 ). The relatively high concentration of 1.6 nmol/l reported in Chanoine et al. 
(1993) most probably originates from the young age of the studied rats. As shown in Heide and Ende -
Visser ( 1980), basal T3 concentrations reach the highest value during the 16 -20 day period and decline 
thereafter, reaching a plateau after 70 days.  
The basal simulated T3 concentration is 1.02 ng/ml (1.57 nmol/l), originating from T4 to T3 conversion 
only, with T3 synthesis rate set to 0.  
For simulations of thyroidectomized rats, synthesis of T3 has been turned off.  
VII.5.2  Humans  
Reported contribution of T3 synthesis to total appearance of T3 in the is between 14% ( Laurberg et al. 
2007) and 20% (Visser, Visser, and Peeters ( n.d.)) for humans.  
Secretion rate of T3 has been selected to reproduce basal T3 concentrations of 1.7 nmol/l at basal T4 
concentrations of 95 nmol/l ( Blakesley et al. 2004 ). The model predicts that 0.3767536 % of total T3 is 
synthesized in thyroid.  
Following parameter values are applied in the model:

VII.6 ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS  
• The current model only considers passive diffusion of TH into cells, no transporter proteins are 
implemented (except for active uptake of T3 into pituitary gland cells). It is reported that not 
only free T3, but also bound to albumin and transthyretin are actively taken up into the cells.  
• Assumption of an active transport across endothelial barrier, the paramerization is not well 
identifiable.  
• Only unspecific hepatic clearance is implemented in humans, no distinction between UGT, DIO, 
and rest.

Internal  • No data could not be identified that would allow to directly parametrize the effect of TSH on 
T3 secretion. It has been assumed that TSH stimulates secretion of T3 with same potency as T4, 
therefore, the same parameter values as for T4 secretion are applie d. 
• UGT metabolization in rats is fitted to 25% of daily production rate (or infused rate). However, 
25-30% of T3 are excreted to feces, and the actual metabolization and biliary excretion fraction 
is not known, as part of glucuronidated T3 is converted back t o T3 and reasborbed in intestine.  
• Active uptake of T3 into pituitary gland and DIO3 catalyzed clearance of T3 in pituitary cells has 
been fitted to rat data and same parametrization (transporter expression, binding kinetics, and 
metabolization rate constant) is applied to human model due t o the lack of data.  
• No thyroidal production of T3 All T3 is coming from T4.

VIII.1 DISTRIBUTION  
For the estimation of distribution kinetics of T4 in rats and humans, T4 concentrations in plasma after 
iv bolus administration were used. The following data sets are available:  
1. iv administration of 1.7e -4 mg T4 in humans (Pilo et al. ( 1990)). Used  for estimation of species -
independent distribution and human -specific clearance parameters.  
2. DiStefano 1982 (J. J. DiStefano, Malone, and Jang ( 1982)). iv administration of T4 in rats. 
Administered were 1.2 ng radiolabeled T4. Reported are T4 concentrations as % dose per ml 
plasma. The data set has been used for fitting.  
3. DiStefano 1993 (J. J. DiStefano, Nguyen, and Yen ( 1993a )). iv administration of 0.16 ng

(Thyroid PB -QST Platform - plasma protein binding.pdf).  
The reported lipophilicity of T4 ranges between -1.89 and 2.98 (non -charged form) logP units 
depending on the microspecies of the molecule (Tóth et al. ( 2013)); the value in the model has been 
set to 2.98 log units.

Permeability of T4 across endothelial barrier is calculated by PK-Sim from molecular weight and 
lipophilicity. For the liver and pituitary gland, the permeability has been manually set to an arbitrary 
value of 100 cm/min. This value is, by default, applied in a small molecules model of PK -Sim, assuming 
rapid extravasa tion of small molecules.  
For the estimation of distribution kinetics of T4 in humans and rats, T4 concentrations in plasma after 
iv bolus administration of 1.7e -4 mg T4 in humans (Pilo et al. (1990)), 5.27 ng/kg bw in rats (J. J. DiStefano 
et al. (1982)), and 7.2e -4 ng/kg bw in rats J. J. DiStefano, Nguyen, and Yen ( 1993a ) have been used. 
While the human data can be well -described with the measured lipophilicity and the fraction unbound 
(fu) predicted in the same range as measured (measured fu 0.03%, (Refetoff ( 2000)), and predicted 
0.025%), rat data cannot be described with the low fu value of 0.3%.  
Similar to T3, active transport of T4 from plasma into interstitial space has been considered. However, 
this process was not required to fit the observed data and has been disabled due to the non -
identifiability of the parameter values. Fitting the model to the data required active transport of T4 into 
liver cells but not into other tiss ues. Expression of T4 transporter in brain pituitary has been estimated 
by fitting to T3 concentration in rat pituitary after iv administration of T4, see Section  VIII.4.

VIII.2 CLEARANCE  
Routes of T4 elimination include outer ring deiodination (ORD) to T3 catalyzed by the enzyme 
iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO) in all tissues (approximately one -third of total daily T4 production in 
humans), inner ring deiodination (IRD) to the biologically i nactive rT3 (approximately one -third of daily 
T4 production in humans), sulfation, and glucuronidation (Visser, Visser, and Peeters ( n.d.)). 
Glucuronidation metabolites are excreted via bile and can be converted back to active T4 and re -
absorbed in the small intestine.  
Different DIO types contribute differently to the conversion of T4 to T3 and rT3. For model simplicity, 
both processes are mediated by the same DIO1 enzyme in the model, with the highest expression in 
the liver and kidneys. The processes are considered to have linear kinetics.  
The following clearance processes are implemented in the model:  
• Glomerular filtration is turned off, as no T4 is detected in urine unchanged (Boonnamsiri, 
Kermode, and Thompson ( 1979)),

Internal  • Converstion of T4 to T3 by the enzyme DIO1,  
• Inner ring diodination of T4 by the enzyme DIO1,  
• UGT metabolized elimination,  
• Unspecific liver clearance in intracellular space.  
VIII.2.1  Humans  
UGT metabolized elimination rate constant has been fitted to reproduce 20% of the T4 production rate. 
This assumption is based on the observation that 20% of T4 is excreted in feces (Visser, Visser, and 
Peeters ( n.d.)). Conversion of T4 to T3 and IRD have been estimated by fitting the model to plasma T4 
and T3 concentrations after administration of 1.7e -4 mg T4 in humans (Pilo et al. ( 1990)). Assuming both 
processes metabolize the same amount of T4 (one -third each), the same metabolization rate constant 
is applied. Unspecific liver clearance represents the remaining T4 metabolization pathways (sulfation). 
Of note is that a reliable identifi cation of this process’ rate is not possible with the available data.  
VIII.2.2  Rats  
In rats, approximately 24 -28% of T4 is excreted in feces in unchanged form (DiSTEFANO and SAPIN 
(1987), Boonnamsiri, Kermode, and Thompson ( 1979)), 33% are converted to T3 (Boonnamsiri, Kermode, 
and Thompson ( 1979)), 12% are excreted as T4 analogs or metabolized via other routes, and T4 to rT3 
conversion amounts to 27%. However, with this contribution of UGT metabolism to T4, the effect of 
UGT inducers is under -estimated. Other sources state 50% of T4 being excrete d in bile (BAS 684 H 
MCA Section 5, page 1327).  
The following parameter values are applied in the model:

VIII.3 PITUITARY GLAND CONCENTRATIONS  
No concentration data of T4 in the pituitary gland is available. Silva 1977 (Silva and Larsen ( 1977)), Group 
C, reports T3 binding to T3R in pituitary gland after iv administration of 800 ng / 100 g bw radiolabeled 
T4 in rats. Expression of T4 interstitial to intracellular transporter and of DIO responsible for the 
conversion of T4 to T3 in the pituitar y gland in rats has been estimated by fitting the model to reported 
T3 concentrations in pituitary gland. As no data for T3 concentrations in human pituitary tissue is 
available, the same expression of the transporter is assumed. The expression of DIO in h umans has 
been fitted to reproduce the observed effect of oral T4 administration on TSH concentrations ( Blakesley 
et al. 2004 ) (see report “Thyroid PB -QST Platform - TSH physiology.pdf”).  
The following parameter values describing the expression of the T4 transporter and DIO in pituitary 
gland are applied:

Parameter  Value rat  Value human  Unit 
Transporter rel. exp. pituitary  5 5  
DIO1 rel. exp. pituitary  65 0.3  
 
The authors did report plasma T3 concentrations below the quantification limit, while the model predicts 
some measurable T3 amounts as the result of T4 to T3 conversion. The reason for this discrepancy is 
not clear.

T3. 
VIII.4 ORAL ABSORPTION  
The bioavailability of orally administered T4 ranges between 40% and 80%. (( Law et al. 2014 ), ID 
DB00451). Dissolution profile of the formulation has been fitted to plasma concentrations of T4 after 
oral administration of 400µg and 600µg in humans (( Blakesley et al. 2004 )). 
VIII.5 SYNTHESIS

secretion of T3. The equations defining the synthesis, transfer, and secretion rates are equal to those 
defined for T3 production.

Internal  VIII.5.1  Rats  
The reported basal T4 concentrations in rats are 29±11 ng/ml (37±14 nmol/l) ( J. J. DiStefano, 
Malone, and Jang 1982 ), 40 ng/ml (51 nmo/l) ( Heide and Ende -Visser 1980 ), 47 and 62 ng/ml (60 and 
79 nmol/l) ( Kinlaw, Schwartz, and Oppenheimer 1985 ), and 46 nmol/l = 35 ng/ml ( Chanoine et al. 
1993a ). The basal T4 concentration in the model has been set to 35 ng/ml (46 nmol/l) and 𝑘𝑇4𝑠𝑦𝑛 has 
been set to a value to reproduce the baseline concentration with 𝑀𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑇4𝑆𝑦𝑛=1 (baseline TSH stimulation).  
No data are available to estimate the dose -response of TSH effect on T4 production. Initially, 
parameters 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇4 and 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 have been set to the same values as for humans, and 𝐾𝑚 has been selected 
such that 𝑀𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑇4𝑆𝑦𝑛=1 at basal plasma TSH concentrations of 0.16 nmol/l. However, this did not allow 
to predict observed effects of UGT induction on T4 concentrations. The value of 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇4 has been 
decreased to reproduce the observed induction data.  
For simulations of thyroidectomized rats, synthesis of T4 has been turned off.  
Humans  
Secretion rate of T4 𝑘𝑇4𝑠𝑦𝑛 has been selected to reproduce basal T4 concentrations of 95 nmol/l 
(Blakesley et al. 2004 ) in humans at basal TSH concentrations ( 𝑀𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑇4𝑆𝑦𝑛 set to 1).  
T4 synthesis is potentiated by TSH by a factor 𝑀𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑇4𝑆𝑦𝑛 given by the equation  
𝑀𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑇4𝑆𝑦𝑛=𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇4×𝐶𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇4
𝐶𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇4+𝐾𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇4 
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇4 is selected to reproduce the maximal T4 concentrations observed in Grave’s disease (GD) patients 
(300 nmol/l, Andrade, Gross, and Maia ( 1999)) assuming maximal stimulation by TSH. 𝐾𝑚 and 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 
have been selected to reproduce basal T4 concentrations in healthy humans at basal TSH 
concentrations.

VIII.6 ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS  
• The current model only considers passive diffusion of TH into cells, no transporter proteins are 
implemented. It is reported that not only free T4, but also bound to albumin and transthyretin 
are actively taken up into the cells.  
• Conversion of T4 to T3 and rT4 is implemented by the same DIO. In vivo, different tissues might 
contribute differently to the processes due to differences in DIO types expression.  
• UGT metabolization is fitted to 20% of daily production rate. However, 20% of T4 are excreted 
to feces, and the actual metabolization and biliary excretion fraction is not known, as part of 
glucuronidated T4 is converted back to T4 and reasborbed in intest ine. 
• Not enough data is available to derive dose -response of TSH on T4 synthesis. Therefore, the 
maximal T4 synthesis rate has been fitted to reproduce maximal T4 concentrations observed in 
GD patients.  
• Model predicts increase of T3 concentrations after oral administration of T4, while the data does 
not show any changes.

IX APPENDIX E: THYROID PB-QST  PLATFORM – TSH  PHYSIOLOGY  
IX.1 DISTRIBUTION  
TSH is modeled as a large molecule and does not distribute into cellular spaces. Selection of the 
partitioning calculation method does not have any effect on simulation results. Transfer from plasma 
into interstitial space is described by the two -pores model implemented in PK -Sim. The fraction 
unbound in plasma is assumed as 100%.  
IX.2  CLEARANCE  
In addition to the default Endosomal clearance implemented in PK -Sim for all peptides, unspecific liver 
plasma clearance in the liver has been added.  
The degradation rate constant for humans and rats has been manually fitted to reproduce the half -life 
of TSH of 65 min (Beck -Peccoz, Bonomi, and Persani ( 2014)) and 13.6 min (D’ANGELO et al. ( 1976)) in 
humans and rats, respectively.  
The following parameter values are applied in the model:

IX.3  SYNTHESIS  
TSH concentrations are often reported in SI units. Conversion between mU/l to ng/ml is done using the 
equation reported in ( “Endocrinology Conversion Factors | PDF | Endocrine System | Organ (Anatomy),” 
n.d.): 
ng/ml = (𝑚𝑈/𝑙+0.9137
50.31)1.35
. 
TSH is synthesized in the pituitary gland and released into the plasma of the pituitary gland. The rate 
of synthesis 𝑟𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑠𝑦𝑛 is controlled by circadian rhythm and the concentration of T3 bound to T3R in the 
pituitary gland:  
𝑟𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑠𝑦𝑛=𝑘𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑠𝑦𝑛×𝑉𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑖𝑡×𝑀𝑇3𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑦𝑛×𝐶𝑖𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑃 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 
with 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛𝑇𝑆𝐻 being the synthesis rate normalized to the volume of pituitary gland intracellular space, 𝑉𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑖𝑡 
the volume of pituitary gland intracellular space, 𝐶𝑖𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑃 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 a factor representing the circadian 
rhythm, and 𝑀𝑇3𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑦𝑛 the effect of T3 on TSH synthesis.  
The equation describing the effect of the circadian phase is given as  
𝐶𝑖𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑃 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒=𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒 ×𝑠𝑖𝑛((2×𝑝𝑖
𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑)×(𝐷𝑎𝑦𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 +𝑥𝑆ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡))+𝑦𝑆ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡 
𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒  defines the extent of circadian fluctuations, circadian period is fixed to 24 hours, 𝑦𝑆ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡=
1 such that the mean value of the function is 1 (representing no potentiation), and 𝑥𝑆ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡 describes the 
shift of the function values in regard to the simulation start time (to account for the differences in 𝑡=0 
between the studies).  
𝑀𝑇3𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑦𝑛 describe s the inhibitory effect of T3 on TSH synthesis, defined as

where 𝐶𝑇3𝑅−𝑇3 is the concentration of the T3 bound to T3 receptor in pituitary intracellular space. In 
the absence of T3, the value of 𝑀𝑇3𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑦𝑛 is zero, implying no inhibition of TSH synthesis.  
The synthesized TSH is added to the slow pool of TSH, from where it is transferred to the ready -to-
release pool; see the description of T3 synthesis and secretion. The rate of transfer between the slow 
and the RRP pools is given by the equation  
𝑟𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠=𝑛𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑤×𝑘𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑇𝑆𝐻. 
From the RRP, TSH is released into the pituitary plasma at the rate  
𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑇𝑆𝐻=𝑛𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑇𝑆𝐻×𝑘𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑇𝑆𝐻×𝑇𝑅𝐻 
where 𝑇𝑅𝐻 is an arbitrary entity describing the effect of thyroid -releasing hormone (TRH). TRH is 
controlled by T3, with its value given by the equation  
𝑇𝑅𝐻=𝑇𝑅𝐻0−𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥×𝐶𝑇3𝑅−𝑇3
𝐸𝐶50𝑇3𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇3
1+𝐶𝑇3𝑅−𝑇3
𝐸𝐶50𝑇3𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇3 
With 𝑇𝑅𝐻0=1, secretion of TSH is not inhibited in the absence of T3. In the current version of the 
model, the value of 𝑇𝑅𝐻 is fixed to 1, as no data were available to parametrize the effect.  
IX.3.1  Rats  
Reported TSH concentrations in normal rats are 100 mU/l ( Chanoine et al. 1993a ) (2.6 ng/ml), 2.1 ng/ml 
(Zorrilla et al. 2009 ), between 6 and 11 ng/ml ( Wong 2005 ), 150 -300 ng/ml ( Tuomisto et al. 1975 ), 2.9 
ng/ml ( Cooper et al. 1983 ), between 50 and 150 µU/ml (1 and 4.4 ng/ml, respectively) ( Silva and Larsen 
1977a ), 0.47 -0.91 µg/ml ( JORDAN et al. 1980 ). The observed amplitude of plasma TSH concentrations 
in rats is between 0.12 and 0.27 µg/ml, depending on the month of the year (Jordan, Perrin, and Mornex 
(1983)). A more recent publication reports TSH concentrations between 0.81 and 19.5 ng/ml, with a 
mean value of 5.06 ng/ml in control rats, and between 15 and >100 ng/ml, with a mean of 51.09 ng/ml 
in hypothyroid rats ( Alves et al. 2017 ). For the model, a basal concentration of 5 ng/ml (0.16 nmol/l) is 
assumed. Circadian rhythm is not considered in this version of the model.

Internal  Maximal reported TSH levels in thyroidectomized rats are 611 mU/l (30 ng/ml) ( Chanoine et al. 1993a ) 
and 1236 µU/ml (75 ng/ml) ( Silva and Larsen 1977b ). The rate of TSH synthesis 𝑘𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑠𝑦𝑛 has been set to a 
value that reproduces 75 ng/ml (2.5 nmol/l) without active T3 ( 𝑀𝑇3𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑦𝑛=1) . 
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇3𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑦𝑛 has been assumed to be 1, implying complete suppression of TSH secretion at high T3 
concentrations. Parameters 𝐸𝐶50𝑇3𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑦𝑛 and 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑇3𝑇𝑆𝐻𝑆𝑦𝑛 were fitted to TSH concentrations reported 
in Silva and Larsen ( 1977b ), Group A, where T3 was administered intravenously to thyroidectomized 
rats. Additionaly, basal TSH concentration of 0.16 nmol/l under basal plasma T3 concentration of 1.06 
ng/ml was considered for the fit.  
Results are shown in the following figure.  
 
Figure 23 iv administration of 70 ng / 100 g bw T3 in rats.  Data from Silva and Larsen (1977b), Group A Pituitary data shows the 
concentration of the receptor -bound T3.  
Parametrization of the TRH effect is not possible with the available data set. Therefore 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇𝑅𝐻 is set to 0.  
Prediction of TSH response after iv administration of 70ng/100g bw T3 or 800ng/100g bw T4 in 
thyroidectomized rats reported in is shown in the next figures.

IX.3.2  Humans  
The value of 𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛𝑇𝑆𝐻 for rats has been selected to reproduce the highest reported TSH values in 
thyroidectomized rats. Since the same data is not available for humans, this approach is not directly 
applicable. In the first step, the values of 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝐸𝐶50𝑇3, and 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 were set to the values estimated 
for the rat species.  
𝑘𝑠𝑦𝑛𝑇𝑆𝐻 and 𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒  were then estimated by fitting the model to TSH concentrations in the basal state 
reported in Eisenberg et al. 2008 (Eisenberg, Samuels, and DiStefano ( 2008)). 
The values of the circadian rhythm effect on TSH synthesis in humans are depicted in  Figure 26.

Internal  IX.4  ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS  
• Circadian rhythm is not considered for rats.  
• Increase of T3 concentrations after iv administration of T4 reported in Larsen and Frumess ( 1977) 
are over -predicted. The contribution of T4 ->T3 pathway to total T4 clearance might require 
additional improvement. Distribution of T4 into tissues or across the endothelial barrier might 
play an important role.

X.1 ORAL ABSORPTION  
The aqueous solubility of PB is 1110 mg/l (( Law et al. 2014 ), ID DB01174). Intestinal permeability is 
calculated by PK -Sim. 
X.2 DISTRIBUTION  
Phenobarbital (PB) is modeled as a small molecule. The reported lipophilicity (logP) is 1.47 log units 
((Law et al. 2014 ), ID DB01174). Fraction unbound in blood plasma is 65% and 58% in rats and humans, 
respectively (data provided by Bayer AG). Acidic pKa values are 7.58 and 11.19 (data provided by Bayer 
AG). 
Selection of the partitioning coefficient (PC) and cellular permeability (CP) calculation methods was 
done by fitting the model to plasma concentrations of PB after iv administration of 30 mg/kg bw and 
50 mg/kg bw in rats ( Engasser et al. 1981 ) and 2.6 mg/kg bw ( Nelson et al. 1982 ) and 130 mg ( Wilensky 
et al. 1982 ) in humans. The combination of the “Rodgers and Rowland” PC method with the “PK -Sim 
standard” CP method was selected. Additionally, lipophilicity was estimated with the same data sets.  
IV administration of 30mg/kg bw and 50mg/kg bw pb in rats leads to higher measured liver tissue 
concentrations than in blood plasma, while concentrations in other tissues remain lower than that in 
plasma ( Engasser et al. 1981 ). The difference between liver tissue and plasma concentrations becomes 
higher during the elimination phase. This behavior could not be described with any PC and CP 
calculation methods. The reason for the high liver PB concentrations could be the binding of PB to its 
targets, like the CYP or the UGT enzymes. To capture this behavior, a not further specified binding 
partner for PB has been implemented in the liver cells. Concentration of the binding partner and the 
binding constant parameters 𝑘𝑜𝑓𝑓 and 𝐾𝑑 have been estimated by fitting the model to liver PB 
concentrations in rats. The same parametrization is assumed for the human model.  
The following physico -chemical parameter values are applied in the model:

In humans, 20 -40% of administered PB dose are eliminated unchanged in urine ( I. Johannessen and 
Johannessen Landmark 2010 ), the rest is slowly metabolized in the liver.  
The model implements glomerular filtration and renal plasma clearance of PB. GFR fraction has been 
fitted to 25% of total dose in humans and assumed to be the same in rats. Specific liver plasma clearance 
has been fitted to plasma PB concentrations of PB a fter iv administration of 30 mg/kg bw and 50 mg/kg 
bw in rats ( Engasser et al. 1981 ) and 2.6 mg/kg bw ( Nelson et al. 1982 ) in humans.

is described by a sigmoidal Emax model. The parameter values are based on in vitro induction studies 
with rat and human hepatocyte cultures reported by ( Baze et al. 2024 ).

Internal  In (Kato et al. 2010 ) a not near specified amount of tracer T4 was administered iv to healthy rats after 
four days of intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg/kg bw phenobarbital daily. The intraperitoneal 
administration was simulated as an intravenous bolus.  
In (McClain et al. 1989 ) male thyroidectomized rats received 1 µg/kg bw tracer T4 following 3 weeks of 
placebo or 100 mg/kg/day phenobarbital administered with food. Administration of PB is modeled as 
a constant intragastric infusion.  
Observed time -concentration profiles of tracer T4 are compared with simulation results in the following 
figures. Direct comparison of simulation results to the observed data is not feasible as the T4 iv data 
shows remarkable inter -study variability (also s ee the T4 and T3 submodel reports). Also the observed 
effect of PB treatment shows a certain variability between the data sets. Some data sets (Kato et al. 
(2010), McClain et al. ( 1989)) show a faster distribution of T4 directly after administration, while the data 
by Wong ( 2005) does not support this effect.

Predicted Effect on Thyroid Hormone Levels   Last saved by: Pavel Balazki  
 
Internal  The absolute values of the TH hormones vary extremely between the different sources, making 
direct comparison unfeasible. Therefero, the changes of basal T3, T4, and TSH concentrations are 
expressed as % from the placebo group.  
Using the in vitro reported values for UGT1A1 induction, the model under -estimates the observed 
effect on T4 clearance (observed after tracer administration of T4) as well as the long -term effect.  
Overall, the model captures the observed increased clearance of T4. The model predicts a slightly 
lower decrease in T4 levels for comparable dose and duration groups, while the decrease in T3 
levels is slightly higher than observed. This might indicate a t oo strong contribution of the T4 ->T3 
metabolization pathway for the total T4 clearance. The predicted increase of TSH is higher than the 
observed, indicating that the model over -predcits the compensatory feedback of decreasing TH on 
TSH secretion.  
A remarkable observation is that with prolonged treatment, the decrease of T4 concentrations 
becomes less expressed, indicating physiological adaptations (e.g., thyroid growth) that are currently 
not captured by the model.

100mg/day phenobarbital treatment in healthy subjects predicts no significant changes in TH levels.  
X.6 ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS  
• Measured in vitro induction values do not allow to reproduce the observed effect on T4 
clearance in rats.  
• Extreme variability of TH values between studies makes direct quantitative comparisons 
impossible.  
• A compensatory effect with prolonged PB treatment is supported by the data and not 
captured by the model.  
• The contribution of T4 to T3 deiodination might be over -predicted by the model  
• The feedback effect of decreasing T3 on TSH secretion might be over -predicted by the 
model
